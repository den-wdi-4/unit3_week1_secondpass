# Unit 3 Week 1 Second Pass

## Definitions

### [What is a directive?](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives)

- A **directive** is a marker on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tells Angular to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners like `click` or `change`), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

>**TLDR:** It is a piece of HTML that allows you to do Javascript things.

### What is a promise?

- A **promise** is a method that eventually produces a value.

Let's take a look at a code example...

This example came from [this blog post](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/javascript-promises).

Not enough on promises?  Check out [this Google mammoth](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises) on Promises.

### Observables and Subjects

## Angular Punctuation

We've learned a lot of Angular punctuation this week.  Here is a quick review of what they all mean:

![](punctuation2.png)

But sometimes we will see properties without the `[]`s around them.  What does that mean?  Well, if we have `[]`, we will evaluate the expression in Javascript.  If we don't, we will simply see the property as a string.  For example:

## Reviewing old Resources

- A lot of helpful links are in the "Resources" section at the bottom of every lesson README.  If you need a second pass on anything we didn't cover today, go back to the bottom section of any particular topic.  If you don't find what you need, please tag Zeb in #wdi6.

## Advice and Words of Encouragement

- Progressing from step-by-step instructions to "Build me the Uber of Popcorn"
- `console.log()` all the things!
  - Not sure if you're on the back end or front end?  `console.log()`
  - Not sure what that variable is? `console.log()`
  - Is this an object or an array?  `console.log()`
  - ....
- Retreading old material is key
  - Zeb needs to look at old lessons to finish their full stack apps, too
- Lately, only difficulty is passing a thing from one place to the next
  - Basically web development in a nutshell
- Such a drive for comprehension
  - Time to start looking for documentation and tutorials
- You are building full-stack apps!
