## Definitions

### [What is a directive?](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)

- A **directive** is a marker on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tells AngularJS to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners like `click` or `change`), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

>**TLDR:** It is a piece of HTML that allows you to do Javascript things.

### What is a promise?

- A **promise** is a method that eventually produces a value.

Let's take a look at a code example...

This example came from [this blog post](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/javascript-promises).

Let's trace the front-end routing in Sensus.

## Tutorials and such:

### Angular Auth

- [Satellizer MEAN stack tutorial](https://hackhands.com/building-instagram-clone-angularjs-satellizer-nodejs-mongodb/)
- [The Angular Auth repo](https://github.com/den-wdi-2/angular-auth-satellizer) has a lot of good resources at the bottom

### ngRoute

- [Documentation](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_routing.asp) at the bottom of [Angular Routing Lab](https://github.com/den-materials/angular_routing_lab)

### Reviewing old "Resources"

- It's worth noting that the [ngResource tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-crud-app-minutes-angulars-resource/) we used for the $resource lesson also in the "Resources" section at the bottom of the README.  If you need a second pass on anything we didn't cover today, go back to the bottom section of any particular topic.  If you don't find what you need, please tag Nick or Zeb in #wdi3.

## Advice and Words of Encouragement

- Progressing from step-by-step instructions to "Build me the Uber of Popcorn"
- `console.log()` all the things!
  - Not sure if you're on the back end or front end?  `console.log()`
  - Not sure what that variable is? `console.log()`
  - Is this an object or an array?  `console.log()`
  - ....
- Retreading old material is key
  - Zeb and Nick needed to look at old lessons to finish their full stack apps, too
- Lately, only difficulty is passing a thing from one place to the next
  - Basically web development in a nutshell
- Such a drive for comprehension
  - Time to start looking for documentation and tutorials
