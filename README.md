# Unit 3 Week 1 Second Pass

## Definitions

### [What is a directive?](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)

- A **directive** is a marker on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tells AngularJS to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners like `click` or `change`), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

>**TLDR:** It is a piece of HTML that allows you to do Javascript things.

This example came from [this blog post](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/javascript-promises).

### Reviewing old Resources

- A lot of helpful links are in the "Resources" section at the bottom of every lesson README.  If you need a second pass on anything we didn't cover today, go back to the bottom section of any particular topic.  If you don't find what you need, please tag Nick or Zeb in #wdi4.
